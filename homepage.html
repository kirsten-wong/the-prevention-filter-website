      A huge problem in society today is the issue of mental health and the inaccurate and harmful broadcasting of it. There are many triggers encountered on the internet as well as copycat suicides from extensive media coverage of celebrity suicides.
    </p>
    
    
    <p>
      What The Prevention Filter is a social application created to prevent people at-risk for suicide from accessing harmful information across the internet. It serves as a filter between the user and the harmful triggers that run rampant on websites. The filter skims through all websites accessed by the user and removes any potential trigger words to prevent any harm. Our mission is to provide this application through schools and community organizations to help the people at risk.
    </p>

    Why Our Method Works
    </h2>
    <p>
      Our method involved the program scraping through the website accessed by the user and removing all of the inappropriate content in a new webpage. This idea of trigger words has been described as a word that causes a person to go into fight or flight response despite the lack of the actual danger present. When a person is reminded of their trauma, their body perceives it as the actual situation.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Our program helps diminish this issue because it removes the issue of being reminded of trauma in the first place by making webpages free of such content. It puts a filter over the internet to make it safer for those with suicidal thoughts to browse through freely without worrying that they will find concerning content.
